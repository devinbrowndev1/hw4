Errors made by Rule-based System:
- PICKUPADDRESS is supposed to only surround the store location for pickup,
  but our regex was catching the words 'pick up' and 'take out' instead
- We didn't have a THANK intent
- Our 'HELLO' intent was looking for the substring 'yo' but that caught strings
  with the word 'you' in them 
- Our NLU class was setting intent and not resetting it to None when beginning
  the next parse
- We needed to expand the phrases that would trigger the REORDER intent
- Overwriting INFORM intents with other intents
